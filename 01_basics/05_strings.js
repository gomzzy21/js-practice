const name ="gomzyyy"
const project =20
// declared two varibles with their values

console.log( "my name is " + name +" i have completed " + project + " projects");
// this way we use before for concating two variables . but its bad practic and confusing one better we use template litterals

//basically it called string interpollation
console.log(`my name is ${name} and i have completed ${project} projects`);
// its good practice and readable .by using this we ll directly using string methods in log itself .
// like ${name.toUppercase} these kind methods we ll use    


// and there are many strings are there in we can actually go through with MDN docs as well as in browser console also.  
//example toUpperCase ,toLowerCase , subString ,IndexOf,String.Contains,split,join,lengthof

let name2 = "gomzzz@21"

console.log(name2.toUpperCase())

console.log(name2.concat(" alfa "))

// like this many of the methods ll use in js to handle the strings in js
